My solutions for 2023 Advent of Code daily puzzles.

Input files are not added as per the request of the puzzle creator.
To add input files, add a folder called "inputFiles" and put the input into a text document called "dayXX.txt" or "dayXXs.txt" for sample input, replacing the XX with the 2 digit day number.
This year I focused on Regex in Java. Outside of this, I learned new skills such as memoization, proper use of enums, and using Records to hold input data. 
Overall a very fun and educational year.
